# Understanding Subscription Types

FierceAI offers different subscription models to fit your needs and budget. Here's what each plan type means and how they work.

---

## 📅 Subscription Plan Types

### 🔄 Monthly Plans

**What it is:** A standard recurring subscription that bills you every month.

**How it works:**
- You pay once a month automatically
- Your credits refresh at the start of each billing cycle
- Subscription continues until you cancel
- Perfect for trying out the platform or short-term projects

**Best for:**
- Testing FierceAI before committing long-term
- Projects with varying monthly needs
- Flexibility to cancel anytime

---

### 📆 Yearly Plans

**What it is:** An annual subscription that bills you once per year.

**How it works:**
- You pay once per year (typically at a discount vs. monthly)
- Your credits refresh annually
- Subscription continues until you cancel
- Save money compared to paying monthly

**Best for:**
- Long-term users who want the best value
- Businesses with predictable annual budgets
- Users committed to using FierceAI regularly

**💡 Tip:** Yearly plans usually offer 20-40% savings compared to monthly plans!

---

### ♾️ Lifetime Plans

**What it is:** A one-time payment for permanent access to your plan.

**How it works:**
- You pay **once** and own it forever
- No recurring charges - ever
- Credits are granted once or based on plan settings
- Access never expires (unless account is terminated for violations)

**Best for:**
- Users who want to avoid recurring charges
- Long-term commitment without monthly billing
- Budget certainty with a one-time investment

**Important:** True lifetime means exactly that - you'll never be charged again for this plan!

### 🔁 Lifetime Plans with Monthly Renewal

**What it is:** A hybrid model - pay once, but credits refresh monthly.

**How it works:**
- You pay **once** upfront (one-time payment)
- Your credits automatically refresh **every month**
- No additional payments required
- You get monthly engagement with new credits forever

**Why this exists:**
- Popular for special deals (like AppSumo offers)
- Combines one-time payment with ongoing value
- Keeps you engaged with fresh credits monthly

**Example:**
> You pay $99 once. Every month, you receive 500 AI credits automatically. This continues forever - no additional payments!

**Best for:**
- Deal hunters (AppSumo, Black Friday offers)
- Users who want predictable monthly resources without monthly bills
- Content creators with regular monthly needs

### 📅 Lifetime Plans with Yearly Renewal

**What it is:** A hybrid model - pay once, but credits refresh annually.

**How it works:**

**Why this exists:**

### 💳 Token Packs (Prepaid)

**What it is:** One-time credit purchase without a subscription.

**How it works:**

- No subscription, no recurring billing
- Buy multiple packs anytime

**Best for:**
- Occasional users who don't need monthly plans

**Example:**

## 💡 Understanding Credit Renewal

- Your credits reset on your billing date
- Unused credits typically don't roll over (check your specific plan)
- You're billed when credits renew

**For Lifetime Plans:**
- **Standard Lifetime:** Credits granted once or never reset
- **Monthly Renewal Lifetime:** Credits refresh every month (no charge)
- **Yearly Renewal Lifetime:** Credits refresh every year (no charge)

## 🔄 Switching Between Plans

You can upgrade, downgrade, or switch between plan types:

- **Upgrade:** Credits from your old plan are preserved
- **Downgrade:** You keep remaining credits until they're used
- **Switch Type:** Move from Monthly to Yearly (or vice versa) easily

Learn more in our [Plan Management Guide](../dashboard/token-management.md).

## ❓ Common Questions

### Can I upgrade my Monthly plan to Lifetime?

Yes! You can purchase a Lifetime plan while on Monthly. Your existing credits will be preserved, and you can cancel your Monthly subscription.

### Do my credits expire with Token Packs?

Most token packs offer non-expiring credits, but check your specific purchase. Credits from token packs are separate from subscription credits.

### What happens if I cancel a Monthly plan mid-cycle?

You keep access and credits until the end of your current billing period. Learn more in [Cancellation Policy](../support/faq.md#cancellation).

### Can I buy multiple Token Packs?

Yes! You can purchase as many token packs as you need. Credits stack and add to your account balance.

### Do Lifetime Monthly Renewal plans really renew forever?

Yes! Once you pay the one-time fee, your credits automatically refresh every month for the life of FierceAI - no additional payments ever.
