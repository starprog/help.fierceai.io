# Vision AI

**Analyze images with powerful AI-driven visual intelligence**

Vision AI enables you to have natural conversations about images. Upload photos, diagrams, screenshots, or any visual content, and ask questions to get detailed descriptions, extract text, identify objects, analyze scenes, and gain insights from visual information.

---

## Overview

Vision AI combines GPT-4o's advanced vision capabilities with conversational AI to create an intelligent image analysis assistant. Whether you need to:

- Describe and analyze photos or artwork
- Extract text from images (OCR)
- Identify objects, people, or scenes
- Analyze diagrams and charts
- Compare multiple images
- Get shopping recommendations from product photos
- Understand complex visual data

Vision AI makes it easy to interact with visual content through natural conversation rather than manual analysis.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Access Vision AI

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → AI Tools → Vision AI**
2. Or visit directly: `https://fierceai.io/dashboard/user/openai/generator/ai_vision/workbook`

### Step 2: Upload Images

Click the image upload button and select one or more images:

- **Supported formats**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP
- **Multiple images**: Upload several images for comparison or batch analysis
- **Image sources**: Local files or URLs

### Step 3: Ask Questions

Once your images are uploaded, you can:

- Ask for descriptions
- Request specific information
- Get text extracted
- Identify objects or people
- Analyze composition
- Compare details

Example questions:
```
What's in this image?
Can you read the text in this screenshot?
What brand is this product?
Describe the scene in detail
What colors are dominant in this photo?
```

### Step 4: Continue the Conversation

Follow up with additional questions or upload more images:

```
Can you be more specific about the background?
What about the second image?
Compare these two photos
Extract all the text you can see
```

## Token Usage

### Current Token Rates

<div id="ai-vision-rate-info" style="padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #2196F3; border-radius: 8px; background: #f5f5f5; margin: 20px 0;">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">📊 Loading current rates...</h4>
  <p style="color: #666;">Please wait while we fetch the latest pricing information.</p>
</div>

### How Tokens Work

Tokens are consumed based on:

1. **Image Processing**: Each image is processed and converted to tokens (varies by size/resolution)
2. **Input Tokens**: Your questions and prompts
3. **Output Tokens**: The AI's responses
4. **Context Tokens**: Previous conversation history and images maintained for context

### Token Cost Breakdown

**Image Token Calculation:**
- Images are scaled to fit within a maximum size
- Tokenization depends on resolution and detail level
- Typical range: 85-1,000 tokens per image
- Higher resolution = more tokens

**Text Token Calculation:**
- Standard word-based tokenization
- Approximately 1 token per word for responses

### Token-Saving Tips

**Optimize Image Size**
- Resize large images before uploading (1024x1024 is usually sufficient)
- Compress images to reduce unnecessary detail
- Crop to focus on relevant areas

**Be Specific with Questions**
- Instead of "Describe this", ask "What text is visible in the top-left?"
- Targeted questions get focused responses with fewer tokens

**Limit Conversation History**
- Start new conversations for unrelated image analysis
- Previous images are kept in context, consuming tokens each time

**Use Lower Resolution When Possible**
- For simple tasks (text extraction, basic identification), lower resolution works fine
- Reserve high resolution for detailed analysis

### Example Token Consumption

| Task | Approximate Token Usage |
|------|------------------------|
| Single image description | 500-1,500 tokens |
| Text extraction from screenshot | 800-2,000 tokens |
| Detailed analysis with follow-ups | 2,000-5,000 tokens |
| Multi-image comparison (3 images) | 3,000-6,000 tokens |
| Complex scene analysis | 1,500-3,500 tokens |

*Note: Actual usage varies based on image size, resolution, and response complexity.*
