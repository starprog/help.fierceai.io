## Token Usage

### Current Token Rates

**AI Voice Clone** uses a fixed-rate token system:

- **Token Type**: Word Credits
- **Rate**: **10 tokens per voice clone** (fixed cost)
- **Billing Model**: One-time charge when creating each voice clone

> 💡 **Important**: Voice cloning uses **Word credits**, not character credits. Make sure you have sufficient Word token balance before creating a voice clone.

### How Tokens Work

AI Voice Clone operations consume a fixed number of tokens per voice creation, regardless of the audio file size or duration.

### How Tokens Are Calculated:
- **Fixed Rate Billing**: Each voice clone creation consumes exactly 10 Word tokens
- **One-Time Cost**: Tokens are charged only when creating the voice clone, not when using it
- **File Size Independent**: Cost remains the same regardless of audio file size or duration
- **Instant Deduction**: 10 Word tokens are deducted immediately upon starting the voice cloning process

### Example Usage Scenarios:

**Single Voice Clone** (10 tokens):
- Upload a 30-second audio sample
- Process: ElevenLabs analyzes and creates voice model
- Result: Custom voice ready for use in other AI features
- Token cost: Fixed 10 tokens per voice clone

**Multiple Voice Variants**:
- Create different voice styles from the same person
- Professional voice: 10 tokens
- Casual voice: 10 tokens  
- Energetic voice: 10 tokens
- Total: 30 tokens for three voice variants

> **Note**: Once created, voice clones can be used unlimited times in voiceovers and other features without additional token costs for the voice clone itself.
