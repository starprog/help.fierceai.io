# AI Writer

## Overview

AI Writer is FierceAI's flagship content generation tool, designed to create high-quality, original content from simple prompts. Whether you need blog posts, articles, marketing copy, product descriptions, or social media content, AI Writer delivers professional results in seconds.

## What Is AI Writer?

AI Writer is a powerful content creation tool that transforms your ideas into polished written content. This tool can:

- **Generate Original Content**: Create blog posts, articles, and marketing copy from simple prompts
- **Multiple Content Types**: Support for 20+ content formats including blogs, ads, emails, and social media
- **Tone & Style Control**: Adjust writing style to match your brand voice
- **Length Flexibility**: Generate short snippets to long-form articles (100-2000+ words)
- **SEO Optimization**: Built-in features to help create search-engine friendly content

## AI Model Used

AI Writer uses the **system-wide default AI writing model** set by administrators. The current default model is:

**<span id="ai-writer-model-display">Loading...</span>**

This model provides a balance of:
- ⚡ Fast content generation
- 💰 Cost-effective token usage
- 🧠 Creative and coherent writing
- 🌐 Multi-language support

> **Note**: The AI model is configured at the system level by administrators. Individual users cannot change this setting.

## Token Usage

AI Writer uses a word-based token calculation system. Tokens are consumed based on the length of the generated content.

<div id="ai-writer-rate-info" style="padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #2196F3; border-radius: 8px; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f5f7fa 0%, #c3cfe2 100%); margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2196F3;">📊 Current Token Rate</h4>
  <p><strong>Rate:</strong> <span style="color: #666;">Loading...</span></p>
  <p style="color: #666; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0;">Dynamically loaded from system settings.</p>
</div>

### How Token Consumption Works

Tokens are calculated based on the generated output:

```
Tokens Used = (Number of words generated) × (Feature rate)
```

**Example**: If AI Writer generates a 500-word blog post and your feature rate is 1.0, you'll be charged approximately 500 tokens.

### Token Consumption Examples

| Content Type | Typical Length | Approximate Tokens |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Social media post | 50-100 words | 50-100 tokens |
| Product description | 100-200 words | 100-200 tokens |
| Blog intro | 150-200 words | 150-200 tokens |
| Email template | 200-300 words | 200-300 tokens |
| Full blog post | 800-1000 words | 800-1000 tokens |
| Long-form article | 1500-2000 words | 1500-2000 tokens |

### Token-Saving Tips

1. **Generate Appropriate Length**: Only request the word count you need
2. **Be Specific**: Clear prompts reduce the need for regeneration
3. **Review First Result**: Edit minor issues instead of regenerating
4. **Use Templates**: Pre-configured templates optimize token usage
5. **Batch Similar Content**: Generate related content in one session

### Good Prompt Example

### Managing Token Usage

1. **Start with Shorter Length**: Generate less, expand if needed
2. **Review Before Regenerating**: Edit minor issues manually
3. **Use Batch Operations**: Generate multiple similar items at once
4. **Monitor Your Balance**: Check tokens before starting large projects
