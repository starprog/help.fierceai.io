## Token Usage

### What You're Charged For

AI Writer consumes tokens based on:

1. **Input tokens**: Your prompts and template fields (minimal)
2. **Output tokens**: The generated content (primary usage)
3. **Creativity level**: Higher creativity may use slightly more tokens
4. **Length setting**: Longer content = more tokens

### Token Consumption Examples

| Content Type | Typical Length | Approximate Tokens |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Social media post | 50-100 words | 100-200 tokens |
| Blog intro paragraph | 150 words | 250-350 tokens |
| Product description | 100-200 words | 200-400 tokens |
| Blog post (full) | 800 words | 1,200-1,600 tokens |
| Email template | 200 words | 300-500 tokens |
| Video script | 500 words | 750-1,000 tokens |

*Actual usage varies based on prompt complexity and output quality.*

### Token-Saving Tips

**Use Shorter Length Settings**
- Generate only what you need
- Expand later if necessary

**Generate One Result First**
- Review before generating multiple variations
- Only generate more if the first isn't perfect

**Be Specific with Prompts**
- Clear prompts = better results on first try
- Reduces need for regeneration

**Choose Appropriate Creativity**
- Lower creativity for factual content (uses fewer tokens)
- Reserve high creativity for marketing/creative content

**Edit Instead of Regenerating**
- Minor tweaks can be done manually
- Full regeneration costs more tokens

## Writing Effective Prompts

### ✅ Good Prompt Examples

**Blog Post:**
```
Write a 800-word blog post about home office productivity tips for remote workers. 
Include 5 actionable strategies, use a friendly but professional tone, and target 
people who recently started working from home.
```

**Product Description:**
```
Create a compelling product description for a wireless Bluetooth headphone with 
noise cancellation. Highlight comfort, sound quality, and 24-hour battery life. 
Target fitness enthusiasts and professionals. Keep it under 150 words.
```

### ❌ Poor Prompt Examples

**Too Vague:**
```
Write about business
```

**No Context:**
```

```

**Missing Details:**
```
Write an article
```

### 💡 Prompt Enhancement Tips

1. **Include Target Audience**: Who will read this content?
2. **Specify Purpose**: Inform, persuade, entertain, educate?
3. **Add Context**: Industry, situation, background information
4. **Define Scope**: Length, format, key points to cover
5. **Set Tone**: Professional, casual, technical, creative
