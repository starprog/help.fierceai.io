## Token Usage

AI Writer uses a word-based token calculation system. Tokens are consumed based on the length of the generated content.

<div id="ai-writer-rate-info" style="padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #2196F3; border-radius: 8px; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f5f7fa 0%, #c3cfe2 100%); margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2196F3;">📊 Current Token Rate</h4>
  <p><strong>Rate:</strong> <span style="color: #666;">Loading...</span></p>
  <p style="color: #666; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0;">Dynamically loaded from system settings.</p>
</div>

### How Token Consumption Works

Tokens are calculated based on the generated output:

```
Tokens Used = (Number of words generated) × (Feature rate)
```

**Example**: If AI Writer generates a 500-word blog post and your feature rate is 1.0, you'll be charged approximately 500 tokens.

### Token Consumption Examples

| Content Type | Typical Length | Approximate Tokens |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Social media post | 50-100 words | 50-100 tokens |
| Product description | 100-200 words | 100-200 tokens |
| Blog intro | 150-200 words | 150-200 tokens |
| Email template | 200-300 words | 200-300 tokens |
| Full blog post | 800-1000 words | 800-1000 tokens |
| Long-form article | 1500-2000 words | 1500-2000 tokens |

### Token-Saving Tips

1. **Generate Appropriate Length**: Only request the word count you need
2. **Be Specific**: Clear prompts reduce the need for regeneration
3. **Review First Result**: Edit minor issues instead of regenerating
4. **Use Templates**: Pre-configured templates optimize token usage
5. **Batch Similar Content**: Generate related content in one session

2. **Review Before Regenerating**: Edit minor issues manually
3. **Use Batch Operations**: Generate multiple similar items at once
