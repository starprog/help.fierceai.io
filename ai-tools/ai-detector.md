## What is AI Detection?

AI Detection is the process of analyzing text content to determine whether it was likely generated by artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or other language models. Our system uses advanced algorithms to identify patterns, writing styles, and characteristics typical of AI-generated content.

## How It Works

### Detection Process

1. **Text Analysis**: Submit your content for comprehensive analysis
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Our system examines writing patterns, sentence structure, and vocabulary usage
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Receive a percentage score indicating the likelihood of AI generation
4. **Detailed Results**: Get insights into specific indicators and explanations

### API Integration

- **Service**: PlagiarismCheck.org API
- **Technology**: Advanced machine learning models trained on vast datasets
- **Accuracy**: High-confidence detection with detailed confidence scores
- **Speed**: Real-time analysis with fast turnaround times

## Features

## Token Usage

Our AI Detector uses a character-based token system similar to our plagiarism checker:

- **Billing Method**: Per character analyzed
- **Token Type**: CHARACTER tokens
- **Rate**: Dynamic pricing based on current API costs
- **Calculation**: Tokens = Character count × Rate per character

### Usage Examples

- **Short Article** (1,000 characters): ~1,500 tokens
- **Blog Post** (3,000 characters): ~4,500 tokens
- **Research Paper** (5,000 characters): ~7,500 tokens

*Actual rates may vary based on current API pricing and are displayed in real-time above.*

## Best Practices

### Optimizing Detection Accuracy

1. **Submit Complete Sections**: Provide full paragraphs rather than fragments
2. **Context Matters**: Include sufficient context for accurate analysis
3. **Clean Text**: Remove formatting that might interfere with analysis
4. **Appropriate Length**: Use substantial text samples (200+ characters recommended)

### Understanding Results

- **High Confidence (80-100%)**: Strong likelihood of AI generation
- **Medium Confidence (50-79%)**: Possible AI generation, review recommended
- **Low Confidence (0-49%)**: Likely human-written content

### Privacy and Security

- **Data Protection**: Submitted content is processed securely
- **No Storage**: Content is not permanently stored after analysis
- **API Security**: All communications use encrypted connections
- **Compliance**: Meets industry standards for data handling

## Getting Started

1. **Access the Tool**: Navigate to your AI Detector dashboard
