## Token Usage

### Current Token Rates

**Token Type**: Minute Credits  
**Rate**: 5.0 tokens per minute of generated music (default rate applied to base entity cost)

### How Tokens Work

AI Music Pro operations consume **MINUTE credits** based on the duration of generated audio. The system uses a fixed token rate that's applied to the base cost of the ElevenLabs AI Music Pro entity.

### How Tokens Are Calculated:
- **Duration-Based Billing**: Token consumption is calculated based on the length of generated music in minutes
- **Precise Measurement**: Charges calculated to the exact duration of audio output
- **Professional Features**: Enhanced capabilities included in per-minute rate
- **Instant Deduction**: Tokens are deducted immediately upon successful music generation

### Example Usage Scenarios:

**Short Commercial Jingle** (30 seconds = 0.5 minutes):
- Create a 30-second commercial jingle
- Process: AI generates professional-quality branded music
- Result: High-quality audio ready for advertising use
- Token cost: 0.5 minutes × rate = precise billing for short content

**Podcast Intro Music** (1 minute):
- Generate a 1-minute podcast introduction theme
- Enhanced control over style and instrumentation
- Professional audio quality for broadcasting
- Token cost: 1 minute × rate = predictable billing

**Background Music Track** (3 minutes):
- Create extended background music for video content
- Advanced style customization and quality settings
- Professional-grade output suitable for commercial use
- Token cost: 3 minutes × rate = duration-based pricing

**Full Song Production** (4.5 minutes):
- Generate complete song with vocals and instrumentation
- Professional mastering and audio enhancement
- Commercial-quality output for music distribution
- Token cost: 4.5 minutes × rate = precise billing based on length

> **Note**: The per-minute billing model ensures you pay only for the exact duration of music generated, making it cost-effective for projects ranging from short jingles to full-length tracks.
