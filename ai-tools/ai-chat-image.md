### Effective Image Descriptions

**Be Descriptive**
- ✅ "A cozy coffee shop with warm lighting, people working on laptops, brick walls, and plants"
- ❌ "Coffee shop"

**Include Key Details**
- Subject: What's the main focus?
- Style: Photorealistic, cartoon, oil painting, etc.
- Setting: Where is this happening?
- Mood: What feeling should it evoke?
- Colors: Any specific color schemes?
- Lighting: Natural, dramatic, soft, etc.

**Use Natural Language**
Good: "Can you create an image of a sunset over mountains with purple and orange sky?"
Great: "I'd like a peaceful mountain landscape at sunset, with vibrant purple and orange clouds, maybe some pine trees in the foreground, photorealistic style"

### Iterative Refinement

**Building on Conversation**
1. First message: "Create a modern office space"
2. AI generates initial image
3. Follow-up: "Can you make it more minimalist with white furniture?"
4. AI considers full context and creates refined version

**Modification Requests**
- "Change the color scheme to blue and gold"
- "Add more people in the scene"
- "Make it look like it's during sunrise"
- "Give it a more artistic, painted style"

### Advanced Techniques

**Style Specifications**
- "In the style of [artist name]"

## Token Usage

### Current Token Rates

AI Chat Image uses **two types of tokens** for different operations:

#### 1. Chat Model Tokens (GPT-4o)
<div id="ai-chat-image-rate-info" style="padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #2196F3; border-radius: 8px; background: #f5f5f5; margin: 20px 0;">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">📊 Loading current chat rates...</h4>
  <p style="color: #666;">Please wait while we fetch the latest pricing information.</p>
</div>

**Chat Model Usage:**
- Powers conversation understanding and responses
- Consumes tokens per word in AI responses
- Used for understanding your image descriptions
- Rate applied to response length

#### 2. Image Generation Tokens (DALL-E 3)
<div id="ai-chat-image-generation-rate-info" style="padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #9C27B0; border-radius: 8px; background: #f5f5f5; margin: 20px 0;">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">🎨 Loading current image generation rates...</h4>
  <p style="color: #666;">Please wait while we fetch the latest pricing information.</p>
</div>

**Image Generation Usage:**
- Powers actual image creation
- Consumes tokens per generated image
- Only charged on successful generation
- Failed generations don't consume tokens

### How Tokens Work

AI Chat Image uses **dual-token calculation** with two separate features:

**Chat Tokens (Word-based):**
- Consumed for AI conversation responses
- Based on length of AI's text replies
- Feature rate multiplier applied to word count
- Example: 100-word response × rate = total tokens

**Image Generation Tokens (Image-based):**
- Consumed only when images are generated
- One token calculation per successful image
- Feature rate multiplier applied per image
- Example: 1 image × rate = total tokens

**Important Notes:**
- Your input messages don't consume chat tokens
- Only AI responses consume chat tokens
- Image generation is charged separately
- Both credit types must be available

**Example:**
If your feature rate is 1.0, generating one image costs 1 token (plus the underlying AI model credits for image generation).

**Cost Considerations:**
- Each image request generates one image
- Multiple images require multiple requests
- Plan your image needs to manage token usage
- Preview ideas through conversation before generating

A: Yes, each image request in the chat generates a new image. Each generation consumes tokens.

**Q: How long does image generation take?**  
A: Typically 10-30 seconds per image. Complex scenes may take slightly longer.

**Q: Can I modify a generated image?**  
A: You can request variations by describing changes in the chat. Each new generation is a separate image.

**Q: Where are generated images saved?**  
A: All images are automatically saved to your Content Manager and stored in cloud storage.

**Q: What resolution are the images?**  
A: Standard output is 1024x1024 pixels, suitable for web and print.

**Q: Can I use generated images commercially?**  
A: Check OpenAI's usage policies and your subscription terms. Generally, you own the rights to images you create.

**Q: What if my image violates content policy?**  
A: Generation will fail. Revise your description to comply with guidelines and try again. No tokens are charged for failed generations.

**Q: Can I generate images of specific people?**  
A: No, you cannot generate images of public figures or real individuals' exact likenesses.

**Q: How do I get consistent style across multiple images?**  
A: Use consistent style descriptions in your requests and reference successful previous approaches.
