## Token Usage

### Current Token Rates

<div id="ai-chat-rate-info" style="padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #2196F3; border-radius: 8px; background: #f5f5f5; margin: 20px 0;">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">📊 Loading current rates...</h4>
  <p style="color: #666;">Please wait while we fetch the latest pricing information.</p>
</div>

### How Tokens Work

AI Chat uses a word-based token calculation system. Tokens are consumed based on the AI's response length:

**Token Calculation:**
- Tokens are counted based on the AI's text response
- Each word in the AI's response consumes tokens
- Your input messages do not directly consume tokens
- Longer, more detailed responses use more tokens
- Code blocks and technical content may use more tokens

**Example:**
If the AI responds with a 200-word answer and your feature rate is 1.0, you'll be charged 200 tokens.

**Token Efficiency Tips:**
- Ask focused, specific questions for concise answers
- Request summaries instead of full explanations when appropriate
- Use "brief" or "concise" in your prompts
- Break complex topics into multiple shorter questions

- Provide examples when helpful

**Conversation Flow**
- Build on previous messages for continuity
- Ask follow-up questions to dig deeper

### Quality & Accuracy

**Verify Information**
