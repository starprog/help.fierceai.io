### What You Need

To use AI Chat Pro, you need **WORD tokens**. All 100+ models in AI Chat Pro use the same token type.

**How it works:**
1. Choose any AI model (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
2. Send your message or upload files
3. AI processes and responds
4. Tokens are deducted based on the response length × current rate

**Example:** If the AI generates a 100-word response and the current rate is 1.0, you'll be charged 100 WORD tokens.
