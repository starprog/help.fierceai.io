## Token Usage

<span id="ai-music-rate-info"></span>

AI Music operations consume a fixed number of tokens per music generation request, regardless of the output duration or complexity.

### How Tokens Are Calculated:
- **Fixed Rate Billing**: Each music generation consumes a predetermined number of tokens
- **Generation-Based Cost**: Tokens are charged per music creation request, not per second of audio
- **Quality Independent**: Cost remains the same regardless of audio quality or complexity settings
- **Instant Deduction**: Tokens are deducted immediately upon successful music generation

### Example Usage Scenarios:

**Original Song Creation** (5 tokens):
- Input lyrics and style preferences
- Process: AI generates complete song with vocals and instruments
- Result: Professional-quality track ready for use
- Token cost: Fixed 5 tokens per generation

**Instrumental Music** (5 tokens):
- Describe desired genre, mood, and instrumentation
- AI creates background music without vocals
- Perfect for videos, podcasts, or ambient content
- Token cost: Fixed 5 tokens per generation

**Voice Composition** (5 tokens):
- Upload audio reference or provide vocal style description
- Generate vocal tracks with AI-enhanced harmonies
- Create choir effects or solo vocal pieces
- Token cost: Fixed 5 tokens per generation

**Multiple Variations**:
- Song version 1: 5 tokens
- Instrumental version: 5 tokens
- Extended remix: 5 tokens
- Total: 15 tokens for three unique variations

> **Note**: The fixed token cost provides predictable billing for music generation, making it easy to budget for creative projects regardless of track length or complexity.
