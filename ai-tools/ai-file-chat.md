### Effective Questioning Techniques

**Be Specific**
- Instead of "What's in this document?" ask "What are the main findings in section 3?"
- Specify page numbers, sections, or topics when known
- Request particular types of information (dates, numbers, names, etc.)

**Use Progressive Questions**
- Start with broad overview questions
- Follow up with specific detail questions
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Build on previous responses

**Request Different Formats**
- "Summarize this in bullet points"
- "Create a table comparing..."
- "List all dates mentioned..."
- "Explain this in simple terms"

### Advanced Usage

**Section-Specific Queries**
- "What does page 15 say about climate change?"

- "Extract all contact information"
- "What are the key dates and events?"
- "Pull out all the recommendations"

**Analysis Requests**
- "What are the main themes in this document?"
- "Compare the methodology in section 2 vs section 4"
- "What evidence supports the main argument?"
- "Identify any contradictions in the text"

**Translation & Transformation**
- "Translate the executive summary to Spanish"
- "Explain the technical terms in layman's language"
- "Convert this data into a narrative"

## Token Usage

AI File Chat uses a word-based token calculation system. Tokens are consumed based on the AI's response length:

<span id="ai-file-chat-rate-info"></span>

**Token Calculation:**
- Tokens are counted based on the AI's text response
- Each word in the AI's response consumes tokens
- Document upload and processing do not consume tokens
- Your questions do not directly consume tokens
- Longer, more detailed responses use more tokens

**Example:**
If the AI provides a 150-word summary of your document and your feature rate is 1.0, you'll be charged 150 tokens.

**Token Efficiency:**
- Ask for concise summaries instead of full document rewrites
- Request specific information rather than broad overviews
- Use bullet points or tables for structured data
- Break large requests into smaller, focused questions

**Initial Upload:**
- Document upload and initial processing: **No tokens charged**
- Only AI responses during conversation consume tokens
- You can upload documents freely and decide what to ask

## Best Practices

### Document Preparation

**File Quality**
- Use clear, readable documents
- Ensure text is searchable (not scanned images without OCR)
- Remove unnecessary pages if possible
- Combine related documents when appropriate

**File Size**
- Optimal size: Under 50 MB
- Larger files take longer to process
- Consider splitting very large documents
- Remove embedded images if text-only analysis needed

**Format Selection**
- PDF works best for formatted documents
- DOCX for editable text documents
- XLSX for data and tables
- Use native formats when possible (not scanned/converted)

### Effective Querying

**Start Broad, Then Narrow**
1. Begin with "What is this document about?"
2. Then ask "What are the main sections?"
3. Finally "Tell me more about [specific section]"

**Be Context-Specific**
- Reference specific pages or sections
- Use document terminology
- Build on previous responses
- Clarify when answers are unclear

**Use the Right Question Type**
- **Summary**: "Summarize..." or "Give me an overview..."
- **Extraction**: "What are..." or "List all..."
- **Explanation**: "Explain..." or "What does [term] mean?"
- **Comparison**: "Compare..." or "What's the difference..."
- **Analysis**: "Why..." or "How does..."

### Managing Token Usage

**Optimize Questions**
- Request "brief summary" for shorter responses
- Ask for bullet points instead of paragraphs
- Get specific data rather than general information
- Combine related questions when possible

**Smart Conversation Structure**
- Plan questions before starting
- Use initial responses to guide follow-ups
- Request page numbers for self-reference
- Take notes to minimize repeat questions

**Document Strategy**
- Review document first if possible
- Ask targeted questions about unclear parts
- Use AI for complex analysis, not basic reading
- Extract and save important responses
