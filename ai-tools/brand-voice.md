# Brand Voice

## Overview

**Brand Voice** is a powerful feature that allows you to create consistent, on-brand AI-generated content across all your projects. Instead of repeatedly introducing your company details in every AI interaction, Brand Voice stores your company information and automatically applies it to AI content generation, ensuring all output aligns with your brand identity.

Generate AI content exclusive to your brand and eliminate the need for repetitive introductions of your company with every request.
