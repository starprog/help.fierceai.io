## Token Usage

<div id="ai-rewriter-rate-info">Loading token rate information...</div>

### How Tokens Are Consumed

AI Rewriter uses token-based billing calculated on the output (rewritten) text:

| Content Length | Approximate Tokens | Typical Usage |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Short Paragraph** (100 words) | ~100 tokens | Quick rewrites, social posts |
| **Medium Content** (500 words) | ~500 tokens | Blog paragraphs, emails |
| **Long Article** (1,500 words) | ~1,500 tokens | Full articles, reports |
| **Extended Content** (3,000+ words) | ~3,000+ tokens | White papers, ebooks |

### Token Calculation

- **Input doesn't count**: Only the rewritten output uses tokens
- **1 token ≈ 1 word** in most languages
- **Shorter modes use fewer tokens**: "Shorten" mode produces less output
- **Expansion uses more**: "Expand" mode generates additional content

### Token-Saving Tips

1. **Choose the Right Mode**: Use "Shorten" to reduce token usage
2. **Process in Sections**: Rewrite long content in chunks
3. **Be Specific**: Clear mode selection prevents re-rewrites
4. **Review Before Rewriting**: Fix obvious errors manually first
5. **Use Simple Mode**: Basic rewrites use fewer tokens than creative expansions
