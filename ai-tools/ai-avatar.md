## Token Usage

Our AI Avatar system uses a video-based token system for each video generated.

  <p style="color: #666; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0;">Dynamically loaded from system settings.</p>
</div>

### How Token Consumption Works

Tokens are consumed on a per-video basis:

```
Tokens Used = Number of videos generated × Feature rate
```

**Example**: If you generate 3 videos and the feature rate is 100 tokens per video, you'll be charged 300 tokens total.

### Token Consumption Examples

| Use Case | Number of Videos | Approximate Tokens |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Single video | 1 video | 100 tokens |
| Training series | 5 videos | 500 tokens |
| Weekly content | 10 videos | 1,000 tokens |
| Monthly content | 20 videos | 2,000 tokens |

*Actual rates are displayed dynamically above and may vary based on current API pricing.*
