## Token Usage

AI Presentation uses a presentation-based token calculation system. Tokens are consumed based on the complexity and size of your generated presentation:

<span id="ai-presentation-rate-info"></span>

**Token Calculation:**
- Tokens are consumed when Gamma AI successfully generates your presentation
- More slides = more tokens consumed
- Advanced features (custom images, detailed content) may increase token usage
- Gamma AI reports exact tokens used, which is multiplied by your feature rate

**Typical Token Ranges:**
- **Simple Presentation** (3-5 slides, basic content): 10-30 tokens
- **Standard Presentation** (6-8 slides, balanced content): 30-60 tokens
- **Complex Presentation** (9-10 slides, detailed content with custom images): 60-100+ tokens

**Important Notes:**
- Tokens are only deducted when generation succeeds
- Failed generations do not consume tokens
- Token usage is displayed in your presentation history
